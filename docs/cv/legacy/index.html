</ul>
<p>A course aimed at providing students a foundation in modern real-time-computable control design through progression from basic theory to advanced control algorithms that have proven successful in practice. Both discrete-time and continuous-time formats are employed and linked through discrete-continuous (sampled-data) concepts. The laboratory part of the course provides exposure to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elements of AI and machine learning proven useful in enhancing these algorithms,</li>
<li>Related Matlab toolboxes and algorithm implementations from the ground up,</li>
<li>Implementation of these algorithms on modern computing platforms (GPUs and FPGAs), and</li>
<li>Applications in aerospace, power generation, manufacturing, and other areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was responsible for grading homework, lab reports, and the final project (a project where students independently explore a robust adaptive control concept and apply it to their research). I was also responsible for developing the lab materials (a rigorous exploration of the theory, followed by interactive code examples and exercises related to real-life applications), in addition to and teaching lab lectures and having office hours. Original lab materials include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An interior point method based constrained discrete-time linear model predictive control (MPC) solver;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A massively parallel GPU implementation of a bank of PID controllers;</p>

<p>Full design and engineering of a sounding rocket and aerially-deployed quadcopter payload as the Technical Manager for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&rsquo;s NASA University Student Launch Initiative team.</p>
<p>This entails managing a team of students to develop an in-house project with limited funds. In addition to production, careful design and simulations are an integral part of the process, and much efforts are invested in the study of highfidelity simulation methods for trajectory, flight loads, and stability assessment.</p>
<p>Finally, advanced robust autonomous control systems design for a quadcopter that can retrieve a ground sample are a unique aspect of the project. Here, I have introduced team members to safety critical programming in C++, and have lead the groundwork to informed system design, as well as controller design and communications protocols between ground and the vehicle.</p>
