I\u0026rsquo;m Hamza, a graduate student in aerospace engineering. I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about all things that fly, especially the part that goes about controling those things\u0026mdash;control theory.\nI like tinkering around with hardware and code to see if my ideas are actually capable of holding water in reality (check out the projects tab for more on that). That\u0026rsquo;s where I feel my drive lies\u0026mdash;bringing theory and practice together, regardless of what their original applications may be.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m not doing research, I like to hike and work on my coding projects, as well as playing tennis or practicing jiujitsu.\n Fig.: Me   "});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/docs/cv/','title':"Curriculum Vitae",'content':"Curriculum Vitae  \nBio  Aerospace engineering student conducting research in adaptive control theory and robust state estimation.\n Academics University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign \u0026mdash; PhD Candidate August 2020\u0026mdash; in Urbana-Champaign, IL \nJointly supervised PhD program in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanical Science and Engineering, focusing on control theory, especially regarding safety-critical control in environments with limited prior knowledge, as well as biomedical applications.\nDelft University of Technology \u0026mdash; Undergraduate Aerospace Engineering September 2017\u0026ndash;July 2020 (3 years) in Delft, The Netherlands \nBachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree in Aerospace Engineering, with a graduation thesis on a cost-effective civilian aircraft flight simulator for upset prevention and recovery training (UPRT).\nDelft University of Technology \u0026mdash; Honours Programme Delft Bachelor Student September 2018\u0026ndash;July 2020 (2 years) in Delft, The Netherlands \nProgram for honors students, including a research segment (14 ECTS) and an interdisciplinary segment (6 ECTS).
